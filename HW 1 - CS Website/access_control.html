                Shows who has access to a certain system. Access can be 
                entering, getting data, or just using the data. This is important
                to know that protecting the data within a database is the most
                important part of security. This can be done in many ways using 
                keys and locks if done physically or electronically with a list
                of authorized users stored within the database. The types of 
                users that are given access can be varied depending on the needs
                that they have from the database. There are standard users who can
                see the databse but don't have access to edit the data. There are 
                semi-priveledged users that can see and edit but only certain parts of 
                the database. Finally there are fully-priveledged users who have access 
                to everything.
