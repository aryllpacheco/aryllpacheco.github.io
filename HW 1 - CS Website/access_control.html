            Shows who has access to a certain system. Access can be 
            entering, getting data, or just using the data. This is important
            to know that protecting the data within a database is the most
            important part of security. This can be done in many ways using 
            keys and locks if done physically or electronically with a list
            of authorized users stored within the database. The types of 
            users that are given access can be varied depending on the needs
            that they have from the database. There are standard users who can
            see the databse but don't have access to edit the data. There are 
            semi-priveledged users that can see and edit but only certain parts of 
            the database. Finally there are fully-priveledged users who have access 
            to everything.
