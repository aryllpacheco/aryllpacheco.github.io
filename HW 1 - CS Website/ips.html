                IPS monitors the systems for potential intrusions and threats
                while blocking them automatically to prevent any further attacks.
                This helps lighten the workload for security teams to automate 
                the process better and allow the security teams to work on solutions
                to other problems that might be occuring in the system. The main ways
                that this is done is through either Signature-Based detection, 
                Anomaly-Based detection, and Police-Based detection. 
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Signature-Based detection reads through the network packets 
                    and looks for behaviors that are connected to known threats.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Anomaly-Based detection looks for anomalies to check for 
                    insecurities that might need patching. 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Police-Based detection looks for threats that break the 
                    known security protocol and attempts to block it from there.
