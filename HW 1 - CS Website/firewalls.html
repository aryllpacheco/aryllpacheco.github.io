            Firewalls are a set of protections that allow people access
            to a certain system while deniying access to others. Firewalls
            are what protects priveleged information like a personal or 
            buisness network from non-priveleged network like the internet.
            There are multiple kinds of firewalls depending on the needs of 
            certain consumers. The main kinds are packet-filtering, proxy, 
            web application, and others. 
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Packet-filtering goes through and 
                checks every bit of information and decides whether it is 
                able to be allowed through the firewall. Might not
                be as effective against sophisticated attacks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Proxy firewalls serve as a gateway to another network by 
                preventing connections going directly into the network.
            </li>

            <li>
                Web application firewalls handle all the requests from the 
                internal network to prevent outside forces from getting
                into the network. The most secure of the three.
